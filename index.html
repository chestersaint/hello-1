          Before we met, i never imagined i'd find someone who was such a perfect match for me and fall deeply in love with. 
          but then that day came and i met you. it was one of those happy accidents that end up being grateful for every single day. 
          the more time I spend with you, the more i find myself completely drawn to her in a heartbeat.

          </p>

          <p>
            I never thought it could be so easy to adore someone, but here i am, totally head over heels for you. 
            meeting you on 16th February was definitely the best unexpected twist in the story of my life, 
            and i'm loving every single minute with you.
